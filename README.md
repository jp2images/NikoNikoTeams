# NikoNikoTeams
An implemention of a Niko Niko calendar as an MS Teams App.

I learned about this in the book [Software Development Metrics](https://www.manning.com/books/software-development-metrics) by David Nicolette

The idea is to gauge a Team's daily mood and compare it over time to get a sense of productivity measurement, team security, morale, and general well-being.
